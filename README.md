### About Me

Hi, I'm Peter (he/him/his) and I am a Los Angeles-based developer. 

I'm actively seeking opportunities for frontend engineer/web developer and/or other developer related roles. I bring 1+ yr exp w/ Javascript and React, and a whole lot more. 

Outside of web development, you can find me geeking out on biomechanics and putting my experience as a physical therapy tech and trainer to use by offering practical support to maximize the long-term health benefits of strength training to those around me.

I am committed to learning from and contributing to an inclusive team. If you are currently looking to fill a role, please feel free to contact me for my resume or  through one of the links below.
