## About Me
Hi, I'm Peter!

Currently a frontend software engineer at [Skilljar](https://www.skilljar.com/) 🍳

I have 3+ years experience developing delightful user experiences, building UI component libraries, enhancing accessibility, and much more. While I consider myself framework-agnostic, I'm familiar with React, Vue, HTML, CSS/SCSS, and Javascript/Typescript. I'm always excited to add to my tookit.

When I'm not coding, I love to explore new coffee shops ☕, get my run on 🏃, lift weights 🏋️, or play cozy video games 🎮.
