## Welcome to my Github profile! 👋🏼

### About Me
Hi, I'm Peter (he/him/his) and I am a Los Angeles-based web developer. If I'm not learning and building on my skills as a developer, I can most likely be found nerding out on strength training 🏋🏻‍♂️ &nbsp;  and biomechanics 💪🏼 &nbsp; as a former physical therapy technician. Every day I look to build on quality habits and embrace a growth mindset to become the best developer and version of myself possible. 🤍

- I am currently learning Typescript and how it can be used to write cleaner and more maintainable Javascript code.
- In addition, I practice algorithms with my fellow boot camp graduates daily. Up next is to learn data structures.
- I am eager to find a great fit in a team where I may best utilize my skillset to make valuable development contributions.
- Below are some projects that I've really enjoyed developing either by myself or in a collaborative effort.

- I may be reached by email at [peeterkang@gmail.com](mailto:peeterkang@gmail.com) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterswkang/).

### Thank you for your time!
