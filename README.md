### About Me

Hi, I'm Peter (he/him/his) and I am a Los Angeles-based developer. When I'm not learning and building on my skills, I can most likely be found nerding out on strength training 🏋🏻‍♂️ &nbsp; and biomechanics 💪🏼 &nbsp; as a former physical therapy technician. Every day I look to build on quality habits and embrace a growth mindset to become the best developer and version of myself possible. 🤍

### Currently I am..

- Tinkering with GraphQL in order to handle data more efficiently
- Learning Typescript and how it can be used to write cleaner and more maintainable Javascript code
- Improving problem-solving skills by practicing algorithms & data structures with my fellow boot camp grads daily

### Blog

Check out my blog [here](https://dev.to/pswk1). Here are a couple of posts that I've written:
